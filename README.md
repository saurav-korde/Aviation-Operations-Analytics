# ✈️ Aviation Operations Analytics

### 📌 Project Overview
This project is a specialized operational analysis designed to optimize airline fleet performance. Leveraging real-world flight data, the solution focuses on identifying the root causes of delays, analyzing route efficiency, and improving overall fleet utilization.

### 🎯 Business Objectives
- **On-Time Performance (OTP):** Analyze delay drivers (weather, carrier, NAS) to recommend mitigation strategies.
- **Route Optimization:** Identify high-traffic and high-delay routes for schedule adjustments.
- **Fleet Utilization:** Visualize aircraft usage patterns to maximize operational efficiency.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack (In Progress)
- **Python (Pandas & NumPy):** High-volume data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn):** Statistical visualization of delay distributions.
- **Power BI:** Interactive executive dashboard for monitoring OTP and fleet metrics.
