# Project 1: Simple Beam Deflection Calculator

This is a command-line tool that calculates the maximum deflection of a standard aluminium cantilever beam. It asks the user to enter a force (in Newtons) and a beam length (in meters) and then prints the result.

## Key Concepts Learned
* Getting user input with the `input()` function.
* Using the `float()` function to convert text into a number that can be used for math.
* Storing values in variables.
* Performing a multi-step calculation.
* Printing the final result to the user.
